				<h2 class="major">Statement of Faith</h2>
				<div class="">
					<br/><br/>
					This church accepts the Bible as our all-sufficient rule for faith and practice. This
					church accepts The General Council of the Assemblies of God Statement of
					Fundamental Truths. The full statement is available at www.ag.org. This statement is
					intended simply as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e., that we all speak the same
					thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10; Acts 2:42). The phraseology employed in this statement is
					not inspired nor contended for, but the truth set forth is held to be essential to a full-
					gospel ministry. No claim is made that it contains all biblical truth, only that it covers
					our need regarding basic biblical doctrines.
					<br/><br/>
					1. The Scriptures Inspired

					The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God and
					are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct
					(2 Timothy 3:15–17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).
					2. The One True God
					<br/><br/>

					The one true God has revealed Himself as the eternally self-existent "I AM," the
					Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed
					Himself as embodying the principles of relationship and association as Father, Son,
					and Holy Spirit (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 43:10–11; Matthew 28:19; Luke 3:22).
					<br/><br/>

					The Adorable Godhead
					(a) Terms Defined
					<br/><br/>

					The terms trinity and persons, as related to the godhead, while not found in the
					Scriptures, are words in harmony with Scripture, whereby we may convey to others
					our immediate understanding of the doctrine of Christ respecting the Being of God,
					as distinguished from "gods many and lords many." We therefore may speak with
					propriety of the Lord our God, who is One Lord, as a Trinity or as one Being of three
					persons, and still be absolutely scriptural (examples, Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians
					13:14; John 14:16–17).
					<br/><br/>

					(b) Distinction and Relationship in the Godhead
					<br/><br/>

					Christ taught a distinction of persons in the godhead which He expressed in specific
					terms of relationship, as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but that this distinction and
					relationship, as to its mode is inscrutable and incomprehensible, because
					unexplained (Luke 1:35; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Matthew 11:25–27; 28:19; 2 Corinthians
					13:14; 1 John 1:3–4).  
					<br/><br/>

					(c) Unity of the One Being of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
					<br/><br/>

					Accordingly, therefore, there is that in the Father which constitutes Him the Father
					and not the Son; there is that in the Son which constitutes Him the Son and not the
					Father; and there is that in the Holy Spirit which constitutes Him the Holy Spirit and
					<br/><br/>

					not either the Father or the Son. Wherefore, the Father is the Begetter; the Son is
					the Begotten; and the Holy Spirit is the One proceeding from the Father and the Son.
					Therefore, because these three persons in the godhead are in a state of unity, there
					is but one Lord God Almighty and His name one (John 1:18; 15:26; 17:11, 21;
					Zechariah 14:9).
					<br/><br/>

					(d) Identity and Cooperation in the Godhead
					<br/><br/>

					The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are never identical as to person; nor
					confused as to relation; nor divided in respect to the godhead; nor opposed as to
					cooperation. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son as to relationship.
					The Son is with the Father and the Father is with the Son, as to fellowship. The
					Father is not from the Son, but the Son is from the Father, as to authority. The Holy
					Spirit is from the Father and the Son proceeding, as to nature, relationship,
					cooperation, and authority. Hence, no person in the godhead either exists or works
					separately or independently of the others (John 5:17–30, 32, 37; 8:17–18).
					<br/><br/>

					(e) The Title, Lord Jesus Christ
					<br/><br/>

					The appellation Lord Jesus Christ is a proper name. It is never applied in the New
					Testament either to the Father or to the Holy Spirit. It therefore belongs exclusively to
					the Son of God (Romans 1:1–3, 7; 2 John 3).
					<br/><br/>

					(f) The Lord Jesus Christ, God with Us
					<br/><br/>

					The Lord Jesus Christ, as to His divine and eternal nature, is the proper and only
					Begotten of the Father, but as to His human nature, He is the proper Son of Man. He
					is, therefore, acknowledged to be both God and man; who because He is God and
					man, is "Immanuel," God with us (Matthew 1:23; 1 John 4:2,10,14; Revelation
					1:13,17).
					<br/><br/>

					(g) The Title, Son of God
					<br/><br/>

					Since the name Immanuel embraces both God and man, in the one person, our Lord
					Jesus Christ, it follows that the title Son of God describes His proper deity, and the
					title Son of Man, His proper humanity. Therefore, the title Son of God belongs to the
					order of eternity, and the title Son of Man to the order of time (Matthew 1:21–23; 2
					John 3; 1 John 3:8; Hebrews 7:3; 1:1–13).
					<br/><br/>

					(h) Transgression of the Doctrine of Christ
					<br/><br/>

					Wherefore, it is a transgression of the doctrine of Christ to say that Jesus Christ
					derived the title Son of God solely from the fact of the Incarnation, or because of His
					relation to the economy of redemption. Therefore, to deny that the Father is a real
					and eternal Father, and that the Son is a real and eternal Son, is a denial of the
					distinction and relationship in the Being of God; a denial of the Father and the Son;
					and a displacement of the truth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh (2 John 9;
					John 1:1–2, 14, 18, 29, 49; 1 John 2:22–23; 4:1–5; Hebrews 12:2).  
					<br/><br/>

					(i) Exaltation of Jesus Christ as Lord
					<br/><br/>

					The Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, having by Himself purged our sins, sat down
					on the right hand of the Majesty on high, angels and principalities and powers having
					been made subject unto Him. And having been made both Lord and Christ, He sent
					the Holy Spirit that we, in the name of Jesus, might bow our knees and confess that
					Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father until the end, when the Son shall
					become subject to the Father that God may be all in all (Hebrews 1:3; 1 Peter 3:22;
					Acts 2:32–36; Romans 14:11; 1 Corinthians 15:24–28).  
					(ii) Equal Honor to the Father and to the Son
					<br/><br/>

					Wherefore, since the Father has delivered all judgment unto the Son, it is not only
					the express duty of all in heaven and on earth to bow the knee, but it is an
					unspeakable joy in the Holy Spirit to ascribe unto the Son all the attributes of deity,
					and to give Him all the honor and the glory contained in all the names and titles of
					the godhead except those which express relationship (see paragraphs b, c, and d),
					and thus honor the Son even as we honor the Father (John 5:22–23; 1 Peter 1:8;
					Revelation 5:6–14; Philippians 2:8–9; Revelation 7:9–10; 4:8–11).  
					3. The Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ
					<br/><br/>

					The Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God. The Scriptures declare: 
					a. His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31, 35).
					b. His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).
					c. His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).
					d. His substitutionary work on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
					e. His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; 1 Corinthians
					15:4).
					f. His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9,11; 2:33; Philippians 2:9–11;
					Hebrews 1:3).
					<br/><br/>

					4. The Fall of Man
					<br/><br/>

					Man was created good and upright; for God said, "Let us make man in our image,
					after our likeness." However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby
					incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from
					God (Genesis 1:26–27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12–19).
					5. The Salvation of Man
					<br/><br/>

					Man's only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son of
					God. 
					<br/><br/>

					a. Conditions to Salvation. Salvation is received through repentance toward God and
					faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of
					the Holy Spirit, being justified by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God
					according to the hope of eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13–15;
					Eph 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5–7). 
					b. The Evidence of Salvation. The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness
					of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). The outward evidence to all men is a life of
					righteousness and true holiness (Ephesians 4:24; Titus 2:12). 
					6. The Ordinances of the Church
					<br/><br/>

					a. Baptism in Water. The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded in
					the Scriptures. All who repent and believe on Christ as Savior and Lord are to be
					baptized. Thus they declare to the world that they have died with Christ and that they
					also have been raised with Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark
					16:16; Acts 10:47–48; Romans 6:4).
					b. Holy Communion. The Lord's Supper, consisting of the elements—bread and the
					fruit of the vine—is the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord
					Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (1 Corinthians
					11:26); and a prophecy of His second coming (1 Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined
					on all believers "till He come!" 
					<br/><br/>

					7. The Baptism in the Holy Spirit
					<br/><br/>

					All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the
					promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fire, according to the
					command of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early
					Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the
					bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts
					1:4, 8; 1 Corinthians 12:1–31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to
					the experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12–17; 10:44–46; 11:14–16; 15:7–9). With
					the baptism in the Holy Spirit come such experiences as an overflowing fullness of
					the Spirit (John 7:37–39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43;
					Hebrews 12:28), an intensified consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts
					2:42), and a more active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).  
					<br/><br/>

					8. The Initial Physical Evidence of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit
					<br/><br/>

					The baptism of believers in the Holy Spirit is witnessed by the initial physical sign of
					speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 2:4).
					The speaking in tongues in this instance is the same in essence as the gift of
					tongues (1 Corinthians 12:4–10, 28), but different in purpose and use.  
					<br/><br/>

					9. Sanctification
					<br/><br/>

					Sanctification is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication unto
					God (Romans 12:1–2; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). Scriptures teach a life
					of "holiness without which no man shall see the Lord" (Hebrews 12:14). By the power
					of the Holy Spirit, we are able to obey the command: "Be ye holy, for I am holy" (1
					Peter 1:15–16). 
					Sanctification is realized in the believer by recognizing his identification with Christ in
					His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that union,
					and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit (Romans
					6:1–11,13; 8:1–2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12–13; 1 Peter 1:5).  
					<br/><br/>

					10. The Church and Its Mission
					<br/><br/>

					The Church is the body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with divine
					appointments for the fulfillment of her Great Commission. Each believer, born of the
					Spirit, is an integral part of the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which
					are written in heaven (Ephesians 1:22– 23; 2:22; Hebrews 12:23).
					Since God's purpose concerning man is to seek and to save that which is lost, to be
					worshipped by man, to build a body of believers in the image of His Son, and to
					demonstrate His love and compassion for all the world, the priority reason for being
					of the Assemblies of God as part of the Church is:  
					a. To be an agency of God for evangelizing the world (Acts 1:8; Matthew 28:19–20;
					Mark 16:15–16).
					b. To be a corporate body in which man may worship God (1 Corinthians 12:13).
					c. To be a channel of God's purpose to build a body of saints being perfected in the
					image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11–16; 1 Corinthians 12:28; 14:12).
					d. To be a people who demonstrate God's love and compassion for all the world
					(Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10; James 1:27).
					The Assemblies of God exists expressly to give continuing emphasis to this reason
					for being in the New Testament apostolic pattern by teaching and encouraging
					believers to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. This experience:  
					a. Enables them to evangelize in the power of the Spirit with accompanying
					supernatural signs (Mark 16:15–20; Acts 4:29–31; Hebrews 2:3–4).
					b. Adds a necessary dimension to a worshipful relationship with God (1 Corinthians
					2:10– 16; 1 Corinthians 12–14).
					c. Enables them to respond to the full working of the Holy Spirit in expression of fruit
					and gifts and ministries as in New Testament times for the edifying of the body of
					Christ and care for the poor and needy of the world (Galatians 5:22–26; Matthew
					25:37–40; Galatians 6:10; 1 Corinthians 14:12; Ephesians 4:11–12; 1 Corinthians
					12:28; Colossians 1:29).  
					<br/><br/>

					11. The Ministry
					<br/><br/>

					A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord for
					the fourfold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) evangelization of the world (Mark
					16:15–20), (2) worship of God (John 4:23–24), (3) building a Body of saints being
					perfected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11,16), and (4) meeting human
					need with ministries of love and compassion (Psalm 112:9; Galatians 2:10; 6:10;
					James 1:27).  
					<br/><br/>

					12. Divine Healing
					<br/><br/>

					Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is provided
					for in the Atonement and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4–5; Matthew
					8:16–17; James 5:14– 16).
					<br/><br/>

					13. The Blessed Hope
					<br/><br/>

					The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation
					together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the
					imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16–17; Romans 8:23;
					Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51–52).
					<br/><br/>

					14. The Millennial Reign of Christ
					<br/><br/>

					The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our blessed
					hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on the earth for
					one thousand years (Zechariah 14:5; Matthew 24:27, 30; Revelation 1:7; 19:11–14;
					20:1–6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel (Ezekiel
					37:21–22; Zephaniah 3:19–20; Romans 11:26–27) and the establishment of
					universal peace (Isaiah 11:6–9; Psalm 72:3–8; Micah 4:3–4).
					15. The Final Judgment
					<br/><br/>

					There will be a final judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged
					according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together
					with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to
					everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is
					the second death (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43–48; Revelation 19:20; 20:11–15;
					21:8).  
					<br/><br/>
